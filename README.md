# Basketball-Reference.com Selenium Web Scraper
Extracts and transforms player data from basketball-reference.com using Selenium and Pandas. Can choose to either get the games of all active players, or only the games of players in a list.

I made this to have access to players' data for some casual exploration & visualization.
Future improvements include using requests instead of selenium.
